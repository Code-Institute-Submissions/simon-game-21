# Simon-Game

This project is about an old game which is called "SimonGame". It is a memory game and really fun to play with friends.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Guide : Explains for users that how they can play.
- ON/OFF checkbox : allows users to turn the game ON and OFF.
- Hard checkbox : allows users to change the game mode from easy to difficult mode.
- Start button : allows users to be able to start the game. (users must turn on the game and see the lightRed "-" on display then the they can click to start the game.)
- Display : allows users to see the game is ON or OFF and also their current round in the game.

### Features Left to Implement
- LeaderBoard will be added.
- the game has currently 20 rounds but we will add more rounds in future.
- Speed-Up for each round will be added in future.
- Option to choose for different background and game-sound will be added.

##### Chrome Dev Tools

I used Dev Tools to check if there was an error on my page. Then, I changed what was wrong in the dev tools and I would be able to see the changes in a live update into my browser.Once I've found the issue I went back to Vscode and make the changes there.

### Debugging

During the process i found a bug which the the position of small-box was not relative to big-box. in CSS file i added "position: Absolute" to #small-box and added "position: relative" to #big-box.

- Guide: NO buggs.
